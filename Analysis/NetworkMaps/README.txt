## This file contains the iAF1260 map/model, central metabolism map, the reactions predicted as key for carbon/nitrogen sources along with the IDs of reactions, excluding transporter reactions.

C1IDs - C7IDs -> Key reactions identified for each of the 7 carbon sources.
N1IDs - N7IDs -> Key reactions identified for each of the 7 Nitrogen sources.
mapRxns.m -> script to draw metabolic maps used in the manuscript.
